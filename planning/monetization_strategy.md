# Grooya - Monetization Strategy

This document provides a strategic analysis of the multi-tier pricing model. It outlines the plan's strengths and the core value propositions that justify the tier structure.

## 1. Core Principles & Rationale

### "Pro" Features vs. Metered Actions
**Decision:** Instead of charging for every design change, we will classify certain high-value Content Blocks (e.g., Testimonials, Services/Pricing) and Design Features (e.g., Custom Palettes, Parallax, Custom CSS) as "Pro."
**Rationale:** This avoids punishing user creativity and experimentation. It provides a clear, tangible reason to upgrade ("I need this professional feature") rather than creating anxiety over using up an arbitrary limit of adjustments.

### Global Assets (Projects & Skills) are Unlimited
**Decision:** The number of projects and skills a user can add to their central library will be unlimited on all plans, including Free.
**Rationale:** This encourages users to deeply invest their professional data into the platform, making Grooya their central "career OS." We monetize the presentation and optimization of this data, not the data entry itself.

### Resumes are a Tier Differentiator
**Decision:** The number of resumes a user can create is a key lever between tiers.
**Rationale:** This maps directly to user needs. A casual user needs one primary resume (Free), a more active job seeker needs a few tailored versions (Starter), and a power user or freelancer needs unlimited versions for every application (Pro).

### Hybrid AI Credit System
**Decision:** AI usage will be managed through a hybrid model. Free users get a one-time trial of each AI text feature. Paid users receive a monthly allotment of credits, separated into Text Credits and Image Credits.
**Rationale:** This allows every user to experience the "magic" of the AI features, demonstrating their value and creating an incentive to upgrade. Separating credit types reflects their different computational costs.

| **AI Text Credits** | 1 free use per feature | 50 / month | 150 / month | 500 / month |
| **AI Image Credits** | — | 10 / month | 30 / month | 100 / month |
| **Customization** | Standard Blocks & Design | Standard Blocks & Design | Pro Blocks & Pro Design | Pro Blocks & Pro Design |

## 3. One-Time Purchases (In addition to Subscriptions)

To cater to users who dislike recurring payments or need temporary boosts, we will offer one-time purchases.

### Consumable Add-ons (Credit Packs)
-   **Purpose:** Allow users to "top-up" their AI credits if they run out mid-cycle without needing to upgrade their entire plan.
-   **Offerings:**
    -   **Text Credit Pack:** e.g., 50 credits for $5.
    -   **Image Credit Pack:** e.g., 10 credits for $10.

### Lifetime License (Pro for Life)
-   **Purpose:** Attract "power users" and those with subscription fatigue by offering permanent access to all Pro-tier features for a single, high-value payment.
-   **Offering:** "Pro for Life" license for a one-time fee (e.g., $199). This includes all current and future features of the Pro tier, but with the standard monthly AI credit allowance of the Pro plan (which would still reset each month).
