# Grooya - Product Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic plan for evolving the Grooya Portfolio Hub from an MVP into a world-class, AI-powered Career Operating System.

## Part 1: Elevating the Design & User Experience (World-Class UI/UX)

Our immediate focus is to refine the user interface and interactions to make the product feel premium, intuitive, and delightful to use.

### ✅ 1. Foundational MVP
- [x] Initial file structure and components.
- [x] Basic portfolio listing, editing, and public view.
- [x] Mock data and localStorage persistence.

### ✅ 2. Overall Aesthetic & Feel
- [x] **Refined Branding:** Establish a stronger "Grooya" visual identity with a sophisticated dark mode default and vibrant gradient accents.
- [x] **Typography Hierarchy:** Define and implement a clear, beautiful typography scale for all text elements (H1, H2, body, etc.).
- [x] **Micro-interactions & Animations:** Integrate a library like Framer Motion to add subtle, delightful animations for page transitions, button clicks, and list loading. (Initial transitions on buttons/cards complete).
- [x] **Consistent Iconography:** Adopt a high-quality, consistent icon set (e.g., Lucide Icons) across the entire application.

### ✅ 3. Portfolio List Page (`PortfolioListPage.tsx`)
- [x] **Visual Portfolio Cards:** Redesign cards to include a small, blurred preview of the portfolio's hero image or a theme color swatch.
- [x] **Consolidated Actions Menu:** Replace separate action buttons with a single "kebab" (three-dot) menu on each card, containing options like `Edit`, `Preview`, `Duplicate`, and `Delete`.
- [x] **Search & Sort:** Implement search functionality to filter portfolios by title and add sorting options (e.g., Last Modified, Date Created).

### ✅ 4. i18n & Mobile-First Foundation
- [x] **Full Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the entire application is usable and beautiful on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- [x] **Adaptive Editor Layout:** Redesign the editor to use a toggle-based view on mobile, switching between a full-screen editor and a full-screen preview.
- [x] **Arabic & RTL Support:** Implement full support for the Arabic language, including a right-to-left (RTL) layout.
- [x] **Localization Framework:** Build a scalable system for adding and managing translations.

### ✅ 5. Portfolio Editor Page (`PortfolioEditorPage.tsx`) - The Core Experience
- [x] **Immersive Layout Redesign:** Transition to a layout where the live preview is dominant, with editor controls in a sleek, collapsible sidebar.
- [x] **Visual Block Inserter:** Replace the `<select>` dropdown with a visual `+` button between blocks that opens a menu with icons for each block type.
- [x] **Enhanced "Design" Studio:**
    - [x] Display color themes as visual color palette swatches.
    - [x] Render font pairing options in their actual fonts for a true preview.
    - [x] Add granular controls for `Spacing`, `Corner Radius`, and a custom `Accent Color Picker`.
- [x] **Direct Manipulation & Inline Editing:** Allow users to edit text directly on the live preview instead of in sidebar form fields.
- [x] **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Implement a smooth drag-and-drop system (e.g., using `dnd-kit`) to reorder portfolio blocks.
