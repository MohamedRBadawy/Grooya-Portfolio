# Grooya - Monetization, Localization, and Growth Rollout Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** In Development

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for transitioning the Grooya Portfolio Hub from its current MVP state into a fully commercial product with a multi-tiered subscription model, deep localization for the MENA region, and a phased go-to-market strategy. It also details the core feature sets designed to drive user acquisition, engagement, and retention.

## 2. Phase 1: Multi-Tier Subscription Model Implementation

**Goal:** Implement a flexible, multi-tier subscription model with regional pricing (EGP-first, then USD) and clear value propositions for each tier.

### Tier Structure & Rationale:

#### "Pro" Features vs. Metered Actions
- **Decision:** Instead of charging for every design change, we will classify certain high-value Content Blocks (e.g., Testimonials, Services/Pricing) and Design Features (e.g., Custom Palettes, Parallax, Custom CSS) as "Pro."
- **Rationale:** This avoids punishing user creativity and experimentation. It provides a clear, tangible reason to upgrade ("I need this professional feature") rather than creating anxiety over using up an arbitrary limit of adjustments.

#### Global Assets (Projects & Skills) are Unlimited
- **Decision:** The number of projects and skills a user can add to their central library will be unlimited on all plans, including Free.
- **Rationale:** This encourages users to deeply invest their professional data into the platform, making Grooya their central "career OS." We monetize the presentation and optimization of this data, not the data entry itself.

#### Resumes are a Tier Differentiator
- **Decision:** The number of resumes a user can create is a key lever between tiers.
- **Rationale:** This maps directly to user needs. A casual user needs one primary resume (Free), a more active job seeker needs a few tailored versions (Starter), and a power user or freelancer needs unlimited versions for every application (Pro).

#### Hybrid AI Credit System
- **Decision:** AI usage will be managed through a hybrid model. Free users get a one-time trial of each AI text feature. Paid users receive a monthly allotment of credits, separated into Text Credits and Image Credits.
- **Rationale:** This allows every user to experience the "magic" of the AI features, demonstrating their value and creating an incentive to upgrade. Separating credit types reflects their different computational costs.

### Action Plan:

#### Backend Development
-   [ ] **Payment Gateway:** Integrate Stripe for handling international subscriptions (USD).
-   [ ] **Local Payments:** Research and integrate a local Egyptian payment provider (e.g., Fawry) for EGP transactions.
-   [ ] **Database Models:**
    -   [ ] Create `Plan` model to store tier details (name, price_egp, price_usd, features).
    -   [x] **(FE)** Expand `User.subscription` model to track `plan_id`, `status` (active, canceled), `renews_at`, `promo_code_used`.
-   [ ] **Webhooks:** Implement a webhook handler to listen for payment events from gateways (e.g., `payment.success`, `subscription.canceled`).

#### Frontend Development
-   [x] **Data Context:** Refactor `DataContext.tsx` to manage the new, more complex `user.subscription` and `user.entitlements` objects.
-   [x] **Entitlements Logic:** Create a robust service (within DataContext) to check a user's permissions based on their active plan (e.g., `can_remove_branding`, `max_portfolios`).
-   [x] **New Pricing Page:** Build a dynamic pricing page that displays all four tiers, allows for annual/monthly toggling (with discount), and shows the correct currency based on user region.
-   [ ] **Billing Management:** Create a "Billing & Subscription" section in the `ProfilePage` where users can view their current plan, usage, renewal date, and manage their subscription.
-   [ ] **Contextual Upgrade Prompts:** Implement UI modals/banners that appear when a user hits a feature limit (e.g., trying to remove branding on the Free plan).

    -   [ ] Implement logic in the subscription flow to validate and apply promo codes.
-   [ ] **User Model:** Add `is_early_adopter` boolean flag to the `User` model, set to `true` upon successful promo code redemption.
-   [ ] **Scheduled Tasks:** Create a nightly cron job to check for expired trials and automatically downgrade users' plans.

#### Frontend Development
-   [x] **Promo Code Input:** Add a promo code field to the new pricing page.
-   [x] **UI Badges:** Display the "Early Adopter" üéñÔ∏è badge in the `AuthenticatedLayout` header and on the `ProfilePage` if `user.is_early_adopter` is true.
